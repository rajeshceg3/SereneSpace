# User Guide - Stillness

This guide explains how to navigate and interact with the Stillness experience.

## A Living World

The world of Stillness is alive and will respond to your presence. The pace of your interaction matters. A calm, deliberate approach will be rewarded with a more expansive and serene environment, while rapid, hurried interactions may cause the world to feel more intimate and focused. Listen to the world, and it will listen to you.

## Core Interactions

The experience is designed to be intuitive and immersive, relying on subtle cues rather than traditional UI elements.

### 1. Scroll (Forward / Back)

- **Action**: Use your mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll.
- **Effect**: Moves the camera forward and backward through the scene, allowing you to approach and move away from destinations.

### 2. Hover (Reveal)

- **Action**: Move your cursor over a destination (the floating spheres).
- **Effect**: A hint will appear, showing the name of the destination. This allows you to identify destinations without clicking on them.

### 3. Click (Deepen Focus)

- **Action**: Click on a destination.
- **Effect**: The camera will move to focus on the selected destination, and the destination's details (name and description) will appear on the screen. The details will remain visible as long as the destination is active.

### 4. Keyboard Navigation (Left / Right)

- **Action**: Use the `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` keys on your keyboard.
- **Effect**: Cycles through the available destinations, automatically moving the camera and bringing each one into focus. This provides an alternative to mouse-based navigation.
